    <p>A pet or companion animal is an animal kept primarily for a person's company, protection, 
        or entertainment rather than as a working animal, livestock, or laboratory animal. 
        Popular pets are often noted for their attractive appearances, intelligence, and relatable 
        personalities.</p>
